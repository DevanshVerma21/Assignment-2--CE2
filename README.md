# To-Do-List
This is a project in which we gonna make a daily task list and the tasks that are needed to be done in particular days.

# Potential Future
We want to make this app to be able to set alarms and also use AI integration to get the best output of the user

# To add tasks in file
just open the file and start writing task in it

# Steps to reslove conflict and merge files in git or github
We can do it in 2 ways:
First:
We open github after commiting things in our git bash and then go to pull requests from where you will be able to compare your branch with the main branch and then just generate pull request in it or might be one will be there already and just simply commit it and you be able to merge both the branches easily.
Second: 
We open git bash and commit changes in another branch and push it
Further we compare files using git diff with that branch name for example main then we resolve the conflicts in it manually and then commit and push it to main then merge both the files this way you be able to resolve the conflict.
